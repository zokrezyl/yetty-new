# libco 3rdparty wrapper. Note: emscripten is intentionally absent from
# the platform list — yetty's webasm coroutine backend uses
# emscripten_fiber_t (Asyncify) directly, see ycoroutine.c on that
# platform. Same exclusion the from-source libs/co.cmake had.
#
# windows-x86_64 is also intentionally absent: the rest of yetty.exe is
# being switched to native MSVC (see the windows-libs-msvc branch). The
# MSVC pattern hasn't landed on main yet, so adding an MSYS2 CLANG64
# build here would produce ABI-incompatible libs that can't link with
# the MSVC yetty.exe. TODO: add windows-x86_64 once windows-libs-msvc
# lands and we can mirror libuv's MSVC path.
#
# Required env:
#   TARGET_PLATFORM   linux-x86_64 | linux-aarch64 |
