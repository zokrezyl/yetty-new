# pdfio — lightweight C library for PDF parsing.
#
# Consumes a prebuilt static lib + headers from the 3rdparty release
# tarball published by build-3rdparty-pdfio.yml. The from-source build
# (compiles 16 .c files directly — pdfio isn't a CMake project upstream)
# lives in build-tools/3rdparty/pdfio/_build.sh.
#
# Exposed target: `pdfio_lib` — IMPORTED static archive.
#
# Note on zlib: the prebuilt archive holds UNRESOLVED zlib references
# (FlateDecode stream filter). Consumers must satisfy them. We add
# ZLIB::ZLIB to INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES so anything linking pdfio_lib
# pulls in zlib transitively. Same model libcurl/libssh2 use for their
# TLS backend deps.
#
# Note on emscripten: the producer bakes in a getrandom() shim source
# (pdfio uses it for AES IV generation; emscripten ships <sys/random.h>
# but no getrandom). No extra consumer-side source needed.
