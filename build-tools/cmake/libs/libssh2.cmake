# libssh2 — SSH2 protocol library.
#
# Consumes a prebuilt static lib + headers from the 3rdparty release
# tarball published by build-3rdparty-libssh2.yml. The from-source build
# (cmake driver, openssl backend, per-platform handling) lives in
# build-tools/3rdparty/libssh2/_build.sh — it links statically against
# the prebuilt openssl tarball we already use.
#
# Exposed target: `libssh2_static` — IMPORTED static archive. Same name
# the from-source CPM build exported, so existing consumers don't need
# to change.
#
# The static archive carries unresolved openssl symbols — consumer must
# wire `OpenSSL::SSL` + `OpenSSL::Crypto` to satisfy them at link time.
# We add those to INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES so anything that links
# libssh2_static pulls in openssl transitively. Same pattern libcurl
# uses.
