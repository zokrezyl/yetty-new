 * ymgui layer — renders Dear ImGui frames produced by client apps.

 * v2 model: the layer hosts a registry of "cards" — placed sub-regions
 * of the terminal grid, each with its own ImGui frame and font atlas.
 * Cards are addressed by client-allocated u32 IDs. Wire details live
 * in include/yetty/ymgui/wire.h.
 *
 * Each card is anchored at a rolling_row at placement time and scrolls
 * with terminal content (same anchoring model the ypaint canvas uses).
 * Width/height are in grid cells; the layer derives pixel size from
 * cell_size. CARD_PLACE on an unknown id creates the card; on a known
 * id moves/resizes it.
