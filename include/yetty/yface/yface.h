/*
 * yetty/yface/yface.h — bidirectional OSC stream wrapper.
 *
 * yface owns two growable byte buffers and the codec state. The OSC code
 * itself identifies the message type; there are no verbs in the body.
 *
 *   in_buf   — accumulates DECODED payload bytes (after b64 decode
 *              + optional LZ4F decompress) for a single received envelope.
 *              Cleared at start of each envelope.
 *   out_buf  — accumulates the OSC ENVELOPE for transport
 *              (\e]<code>;<b64-args>;<b64-payload>\e\\). The caller ships
 *              out_buf.data[..size] over its transport and clears it.
 *
 * Wire shape (uniform across all yface-encoded OSCs):
 *
 *     \e]<code>;<b64-args>;<b64-payload>\e\\
 *
 *   <code>     — the OSC code itself is the discriminator (no verbs).
 *                Codes are allocated by the consumer; yface is
 *                content-agnostic.
 *   <args>     — per-code binary header (b64 on the wire). For "bin"
 *                codes carrying compressed/large payloads this is a
 *                yetty_yface_bin_meta. For codes with no parameters
 *                (clear, mouse, resize, …) this slot is empty — the wire
 *                still carries `;;` so receivers always split the same
 *                way.
 *   <payload>  — body bytes (b64 on the wire, optionally LZ4F-compressed
 *                if the bin meta says so).
 *
 * Whether the body is LZ4F-compressed is a per-code policy known to
 * both sides; for bin codes the meta in args makes it self-describing
 * so receivers don't need an extra map.
 *
 * Outgoing pipeline (caller → wire):
 *
 *     yetty_yface_start_write(yface, osc_code, compressed, args, args_len);
 *         emits "\e]<code>;" raw, b64-encodes args bytes (if any) into
 *         the args slot, then ";", opens an LZ4F frame if compressed=1,
 *         and starts the streaming b64 encoder for the payload.
 *
 *     yetty_yface_write(yface, src, len);          // any number of times
 *         feeds bytes into the codec; produced bytes go through b64 into
 *         out_buf. May emit zero bytes (LZ4F batches up to its block size).
 *
 *     yetty_yface_finish_write(yface);
 *         flushes codec + b64 + writes "\e\\". out_buf is now a complete
 *         OSC sequence ready for write(2).
 *
 * Incoming pipeline (wire → consumer):
 *
 *     yetty_yface_set_handlers(yface, on_osc, on_raw, user);
 *     yetty_yface_feed_bytes(yface, raw, n);         // any number of times
 *
 *         The stream scanner finds \e]…\e\\ envelopes in `raw`, b64-
 *         decodes the args slot, b64-decodes the payload (running it
 *         through LZ4F if the bin meta says so), and fires
 *         `on_osc(user, osc_code, args, args_len, payload, payload_len)`.
 *         Any bytes outside an envelope are forwarded verbatim through
 *         `on_raw` so consumers can keep their raw-byte handling
 *         (keyboard, CSI, …) alongside structured OSC events.
