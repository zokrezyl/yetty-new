/*
 * tile-diff.h - GPU-accelerated tile-granularity frame diff engine.
 *
 * Compares a submitted texture against the previously-submitted one using
 * a compute shader, reads back both the rendered pixels and a per-tile
 * dirty bitmap, and hands the result to a caller-supplied sink. The sink
 * decides what to do with the dirty tiles: the VNC server encodes them and
 * ships them over the wire; a future X11-tile render target will XShmPutImage
 * them to a window; a debug tool could dump them to disk.
 *
 * The engine is output-agnostic. It owns the GPU pipeline, the previous-
 * frame texture, the dirty-flag storage buffer, the row-aligned readback
 * buffer, and the coroutine that awaits the maps. It does not know anything
 * about VNC, X11, or terminals.

 * to manifest as a "one-character delay" in nvim: the first render put the
 * texture on-screen, the second render updated the texture but its submit
 * was dropped, and the user only saw it after yet another input triggered
 * a third render. With this callback, engines fire a catch-up render on
