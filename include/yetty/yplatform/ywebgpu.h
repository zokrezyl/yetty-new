/*
 * yplatform/ywebgpu.h - Coroutine-aware WebGPU await wrappers.
 *
 * struct yplatform_wgpu owns the per-instance state (the WGPUInstance handle,
 * a back-pointer to the event loop, the periodic ProcessEvents tick). It is
 * created once at startup and threaded explicitly to anyone that needs to
 * call an _await wrapper — there is no global state.
 *
 * Both _await wrappers MUST be called from within a coroutine. They yield
 * the coroutine until the corresponding wgpu callback fires, then resume
 * it on the event-loop thread via event_loop->ops->post_to_loop.
 *
 * Desktop drives wgpuInstanceProcessEvents from a libuv timer on the loop
 * thread (same thread as wgpuQueueSubmit). Webasm version (TBD) will have
 * no tick — emscripten's WebGPU implementation drives callbacks from the
 * JS event loop directly.
