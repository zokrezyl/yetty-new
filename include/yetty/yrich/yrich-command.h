 * yrich-command — undo/redo facade.

 * A command bundles the operations that result from one user action so they
 * can be undone as a unit. The C port keeps the vtable shape (description,
 * execute, undo, redo, mergeWith) but stores each command's operations in a
 * flat array and reuses yetty_yrich_operation_inverse for undo.
