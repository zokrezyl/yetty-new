/*
 * ymgui_encode.h — non-blocking write helper used by the ymgui frontend.
 *
 * The OSC envelope + base64 + LZ4F compression now all live in
 * yetty_yface (see <yetty/yface/yface.h>). The frontend builds an OSC
 * sequence by feeding the wire structs into yface, then asks for the
 * resulting bytes via yetty_yface_out_buf() — those bytes are pushed
 * to the PTY through this helper.
 *
 * This file is what's left of the previous helper: just the at-most-
 * one-in-flight non-blocking write queue. Its job is to keep the demo
 * loop from blocking when yetty's PTY backpressures.
